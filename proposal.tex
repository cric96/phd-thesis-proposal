\abstract{
This thesis aims to define a path towards the Engineering of cypher-physical swarms - where swarms are seen in a  modern key,  including swarm robotics,  large-scale  IoT scenarios,  and crowd engineering  (tracking and control). 
supported
%
CPSWs are backed by emerging trends like autonomic, pervasive, ubiquitous computing that foster a vision of distributed systems composed of a considerable number of simple entities that collectively perform complex tasks.
%
These systems are similar to natural social-animal groups, where plentiful animals achieve complex tasks (like ants, sheep, ...).
%
Furthermore, these behaviour are typically achieved through self-organization, making the system robust to failures and highly scalable
%
Inspired by nature, we define the notion of ``Cypher-Physical Swarm'' -- the extension of `Swarms' (of people, of computers, of things) in computer science.
Engineering this kind of system with traditional approaches is inadequate, 
due to the distributed control, high-rate failure, openness, and local-to-global behaviour mapping.
%
My thesis is focused on finding a systematic and reproducible way to execute this design process. 
In particular, we plan to leverage Aggregate Computing -- a novel top-down global-to-local programming model.
The latter is used to \emph{program} self-stabilization behaviours through a functional and composable 
manipulation of \emph{computational fields}.
%
At the same time, we consider leveraging Machine Learning to improve \emph{adapativity} -- both at the middleware level and the Aggregate Computing specification language.
%
As a final result of my PhD, we intend to reach a seamless integration of Aggregate Computing and Machine Learning, making the collective behaviour specification smarter, more effective and faster}
