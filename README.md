# PhD thesis proposal

This document contains my proposal for the PhD thesis.

My research mainly consists of engineering Cypher-Physical swarm (CPSW) -- the extension of the natural swarm concept to the topics of IoT and large distributed systems.

In this document, I describe the current state-of-the-art solutions to handle CPSW, the research gap in which my works are placed, preliminary results done in my first year of PhD and finally
a projection of the next two-year research work that I will intend to do.
