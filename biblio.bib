  abstract  = {Field-based coordination is a model for expressing the coordination logic of large-scale adaptive systems, composing functional blocks from a global perspective. As for any coordination model, a proper toolchain must be developed to support its adoption across all development phases. Under this point of view, the ScaFi toolkit provides a coordination language (field calculus) as a DSL internal in the Scala language, a library of reusable building blocks, and an infrastructure for simulation of distributed deployments. In this work, we enrich such a toolchain by introducing ScaFi-Web, a web-based application allowing in-browser editing, execution, and visualisation of ScaFi programs. ScaFi-Web facilitates access to the ScaFi coordination technology by flattening the learning curve and simplifying configuration and requirements, thus promoting agile prototyping of field-based coordination specifications. In turn, this opens the door to easier demonstrations and experimentation, and also constitutes a stepping stone towards monitoring and control of simulated/deployed systems.}

  abstract  = {Research and technology developments on autonomous agents and autonomic computing promote a vision of artificial systems that are able to resiliently manage themselves and autonomously deal with issues at runtime in dynamic environments. Indeed, autonomy can be leveraged to unburden humans from mundane tasks (cf. driving and autonomous vehicles), from the risk of operating in unknown or perilous environments (cf. rescue scenarios), or to support timely decision-making in complex settings (cf. data-centre operations). Beyond the results that individual autonomous agents can carry out, a further opportunity lies in the collaboration of multiple agents or robots. Emerging macro-paradigms provide an approach to programming whole collectives towards global goals. Aggregate computing is one such paradigm, formally grounded in a calculus of computational fields enabling functional composition of collective behaviours that could be proved, under certain technical conditions, to be self-stabilising. In this work, we address the concept of collective autonomy, i.e., the form of autonomy that applies at the level of a group of individuals. As a contribution, we define an agent control architecture for aggregate multi-agent systems, discuss how the aggregate computing framework relates to both individual and collective autonomy, and show how it can be used to program collective autonomous behaviour. We exemplify the concepts through a simulated case study, and outline a research roadmap towards reliable aggregate autonomy.}

  abstract  = {Collective adaptive systems (CASs) are challenging
from the engineering perspective. Different techniques aim at
taming these systems, either using declarative or black-box approaches (e.g. Machine Learning, Evolutionary Algorithms, etc.).
Among the many declarative approaches, Aggregate Computing
is a novel technique by which developers can express collective
system behaviours from a global perspective, using a compositional and functional programming technique. Over the years,
Aggregate Computing has been applied in different scenarios,
ranging from smart cities to a crowd of augmented people.
Despite its promising capabilities, it is sometimes challenging to
describe aggregate behaviours, so we aim at merging Aggregate
Computing with black-box techniques to simplify the aggregate
program synthesis}

_abstract = "Aggregate computing is an emerging approach to the engineering of complex coordination for distributed systems, based on viewing system interactions in terms of information propagating through collectives of devices, rather than in terms of individual devices and their interaction with their peers and environment. The foundation of this approach is the distillation of a number of prior approaches, both formal and pragmatic, proposed under the umbrella of field-based coordination, and culminating into the field calculus, a universal functional programming model for the specification and composition of collective behaviours with equivalent local and aggregate semantics. This foundation has been elaborated into a layered approach to engineering coordination of complex distributed systems, building up to pragmatic applications through intermediate layers encompassing reusable libraries of program components. Furthermore, some of these components are formally shown to satisfy formal properties like self-stabilisation, which transfer to whole application services by functional composition. In this survey, we trace the development and antecedents of field calculus, review the field calculus itself and the current state of aggregate computing theory and practice, and discuss a roadmap of current research directions with implications for the development of a broad range of distributed systems."
